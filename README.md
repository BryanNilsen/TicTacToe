# Tic Tac Toe

My solution to the following challenge:
```
1. Create a grid of nine boxes
2. When any box is clicked a red `X` appears
3. When the next box is clicked a Blue `O` appears
4. #1 and #2 are repeated until a row of 3 of the same character is created
5. When a win happens:
    a. Alert the players who won
    b. Disallow any further clicks on the game board
    c. Display a `Play Again` button that resets the game
6. For a tie:
    a. Alert players that game has ended in a tie
    b. Display a `Play Again` button that resets the game
```
